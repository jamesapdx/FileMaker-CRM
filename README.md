# FileMaker-CRM
Custom FileMaker CRM, including Contacts, Quotes, Orders, Invoices, and Purchase Orders

FileMaker-CRM is a custom CRM and quote/order management system that I developed
using the FileMaker database software and was used internally in my business. 
The final product represents over 1500 hours of programming and development and evolved
over a period of ten years from 2000 to 2010.  

FileMaker is a small to mid size business database software that is completely programmable.  It
is a relational database that features an advanced scripting language with complex commands
and functions, sophisticated table and relationship designs, and front-end GUI tools that are
used to design custom screen layouts.

FileMaker-CRM is comprised of approximately:
* 20 tables with over 500 fields
* 70 table relationships
* 30 screens
* 190 scripts containing 4500 lines of code

Printouts of the scripts are provided in this repository.  Screen shots, table designs,
and feature descriptions will be added in the near future.
